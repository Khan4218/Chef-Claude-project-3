### ðŸš§ Section 3: In Progress

- Section 3 focuses on state, forms, and conditional rendering in React. Here's a summary of the concepts being explored:
- Props vs. State in React
- Using the useState hook
- Updating state (primitives, arrays, and objects)
- State change with callbacks
- Toggling state with ternary and &&
- React forms: input, textarea, radio, checkbox, select
- Handling form submissions
- Conditional rendering (&&, ternary operators)
- Passing state between components
- Shared vs. local state
- Dynamically applying styles
- Real-world app simulation with interactive challenges
- Fetching data from APIs and handling responses

## What's Next

ðŸ”œ What's Next
ðŸš§ Section 4: Coming Up
- In this section, I'm diving deeper into advanced React concepts with a fun Meme Generator App project. Here's whatâ€™s on the roadmap:
- Meme Generator Starting Point
- Managing state for meme data
- Controlled Components (Parts 1 & 2)
- Planning and performing data fetches
- Functional programming in React
- Fetching meme data from an API
- Introduction to useEffect
- useEffect syntax and default behavior
- Understanding the dependencies array
- useEffect with empty dependency array
- useEffect quizzes and practical exercises
- Using useEffect to fetch memes
- Combined state and effect practices
- Cleanup functions in useEffect
- Generating a random meme
- Sneak peek into Refs in React
- Practical use: scrollIntoView() with useRef
- Fixing iframe scroll bug
- Wrapping up with a Section 4 summary
- Stay tuned as I implement, break, fix, and learn from building an interactive meme generator powered by external APIs and React hooks!
